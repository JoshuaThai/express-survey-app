# Express Survey Application
## About this:
This is an web-based application using Express.js and SQLite to develop a working survey that asked users for their response regarding modern video games. After the completion of the survey, the users will be redirected to a page where they can see the compiled results of the survey.
## Purpose
This project is designed to help me expand on my understanding of databases, practice crucial web-development skills such the as the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and working with a framework, and practice working with middleware.
## Future Plan(s):
I am planning to add a login/sign-up page, add more pages to complete the survey portion of the project, and implement SQLite to have a working database that preserve the results of the survey.
