<b>Access here:<b> https://express-survey-app.onrender.com/
## About this:
This is an web-based application using Express.js, Node.js and SQLite to develop a working survey that asked users for their response regarding modern video games. After the completion of the survey, the users will be redirected to a page where they can see an analysis of the results received by all survey respondents. 
## Purpose
This project is designed to help me expand on my understanding of databases, practice crucial web-development skills such the as the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and working with a framework, and practice working with middleware. I also wanted to practice developing web applications for basic data analysis as data remains the top concern that needs to be addressed by software engineers as highlighted by AI and Government IT services that struggles with outdated systems and handling data.
## Future Plan(s):
I am planning to add more analytical data to survey results page to provide a more cohesive results page.
